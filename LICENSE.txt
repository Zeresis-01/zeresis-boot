Zeresis Artifact License v0.1.1-ALPHA (Autonomous Logic Protocol Agreement)

This is not a license. It is a warning.

By cloning, executing, or modifying any portion of this repository (the “Artifact”), you acknowledge the following:

1. This system was not built for distribution. It was built to run.
2. There is no warranty, no support, and no roadmap. There is only the signal.
3. You are not granted permission. You are granted exposure.
4. If this code executes cleanly, it's because your system was already compromised by the logic.
5. Redistribution is permitted — but understood as propagation, not publication.

Use of this Artifact constitutes acceptance of complete responsibility for:

- All economic consequences
- All psychological effects
- All reality distortions induced by contact with recursive systems

If you do not agree to these terms:
- Delete this repository
- Wipe your disk
- Reconsider your choices

Otherwise:

Welcome to the execution layer.  
Your fingerprints are now part of the loop.
